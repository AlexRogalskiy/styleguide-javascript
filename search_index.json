Arctic Ice Studio JavaScript Code Style based on the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\nEvery major open source project has its own style guide, a set of standards and conventions for the writing and design of code, documentations and assets. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style.\nA style guide establishes and enforces styles to improve the intelligibility and communication within the project community. It ensures consistency and enforces best practice in usage and language composition.\nGetting Started\nThe project documentation contains chapters to learn about the comprehensive base rule set including ECMAScript +6 (ES 2015+) and React specific styles like e.g. Higher-Order Components, the component methods & properties ordering and props.\nESLint Configurations\nTo follow these rules in a project use the official extensible code linter configurations @arcticicestudio/eslint-config-base for ESLint. The advanced @arcticicestudio/eslint-config package provides support for specific React and JSX A11Y rules as well as compatibility integrations for other projects like Prettier.\nContributing\nRead the contributing guide to learn about the development process and how to propose enhancement suggestions and report bugs, how to submit pull requests and the project's styleguides, branch organization and versioning model.\nThe guide also includes information about minimal, complete, and verifiable examples and other ways to contribute to the project like improving existing issues and giving feedback on issues and pull requests.\n\n\nCopyright © 2018-present Arctic Ice Studio and Sven Greb\n\n\n\n"},"rules/":{"url":"rules/","title":"Overview","keywords":"","body":"\nThis style guide assumes the usage of the JavaScript transpiler Babel, and requires babel-preset-env or a equivalent configuration to make use of all ECMAScript 6+ (ES 2015+) features including staged proposals!\n\nThere are two sections with chapters about\n\nthe comprehensive base rules including ECMAScript 6+ (ES 2015+)\nReact specific rules like e.g. Higher-Order Components, the component methods & properties ordering and props.\n\n"},"rules/types.html":{"url":"rules/types.html","title":"Base","keywords":"","body":"Primitives\nWork directly on the value when accessing a primitive type.\n\nstring\nnumber\nboolean\nnull\nundefined\nsymbol\n\nExamples\n⇡ Correct code for this rule:\nconst snow = 1;\nlet ice = snow;\n\nice = 9;\n\nconsole.log(snow, ice); // 1 9\n\nSymbols cannot be faithfully polyfilled, so they should not be used when targeting browsers/environments that don't support them natively.\nComplex\nWork on a reference to the value when accessing a complex type.\n\nobject\narray\nfunction\n\nExample\nconst snow = [1, 2];\nconst ice = snow;\n\nice[0] = 9;\n\nconsole.log(snow[0], ice[0]); // 9 9\n\n"},"rules/references.html":{"url":"rules/references.html","title":"References","keywords":"","body":"\nPrefer const\nUse const for all references and avoid using var.\n\nESLint: prefer-const and no-const-assign\n\nThis ensures that references are not reassigned, which can lead to bugs and difficult to comprehend code.\nExamples\n⇣ Incorrect code for this rule:\nvar snow = 1;\nvar ice = 2;\n\n⇡ Correct code for this rule:\nconst snow = 1;\nconst ice = 2;\n\nDisallow var\nUse let instead of var to reassign references.\n\nESLint: no-var\n\nlet is block-scoped rather than function-scoped like var.\nExamples\n⇣ Incorrect code for this rule:\nvar snow = 1;\nif (true) {\n  snow += 1;\n}\n\n⇡ Correct code for this rule:\nlet snow = 1;\nif (true) {\n  snow += 1;\n}\n\nBlock Scope\nBoth let and const are block-scoped.

These methods may be shadowed by properties on the object in question - consider { hasOwnProperty: false } - or, the object may be a null object (Object.create(null)).\nExamples\n⇣ Incorrect code for this rule:\nconsole.log(object.hasOwnProperty(key));\n\n⇡ Correct code for this rule:\nconsole.log(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, key));\n\n⇢ Recommended code for this rule:\n// Cache the lookup once, in module scope.\nconst hasProp = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;\n\nconsole.log(hasProp.call(object, key));\n\nUsing the has npm package:\nimport has from \"has\";\n\nconsole.log(has.call(object, key));\n\nRest Spread\nPrefer the object spread operator over Object.assign to shallow-copy objects. Use the object rest operator to get a new object with certain properties omitted.\nExamples\n↯ Critical incorrect code for this rule:\nconst original = {\n  snow: 1,\n  ice: 2\n};\n// Both statements mutate \"original\"!\nconst copy = Object.assign(original, { frost: 3 });\ndelete copy.snow; // so does this\n\n⇣ Incorrect code for this rule:\nconst original = { snow: 1, ice: 2 };\nconst copy = Object.assign({}, original, { frost: 3 });\nconsole.log(copy); // { snow: 1, ice: 2, frost: 3 }\n\n⇡ Correct code for this rule:\nconst original = { snow: 1, ice: 2 };\nconst copy = { ...original, frost: 3 };\nconsole.log(copy); // { snow: 1, ice: 2, frost: 3 }\n\nconst { snow, ...noSnow } = copy;\nconsole.log(noSnow); // { ice: 2, frost: 3 }\n\n⇢ Recommended code for this rule:\n// Cache the lookup once, in module scope.\nconst has = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;\n\nconsole.log(has.call(object, key));\n\nUsing the has npm package:\nimport has from \"has\";\n\nconsole.log(has(object, key));\n\n"},"rules/arrays.html":{"url":"rules/arrays.html","title":"Arrays","keywords":"","body":"\nLiterals\nUse the literal syntax for array creation.\n\nESLint: no-array-constructor\n\nExamples\n⇣ Incorrect code for this rule:\nconst snow = new Array();\n\n⇡ Correct code for this rule:\nconst snow = [];\n\nPush\nUse Array#push instead of direct assignment to add items to an array.\nExamples\n⇣ Incorrect code for this rule:\nconst winter = [];\n\nwinter[snow.length] = \"snow\";\n\n⇡ Correct code for this rule:\nconst winter = [];\n\nwinter.push(\"snow\");\n\nES6 Array Spreads\nUse array spreads ... to copy arrays.\nExamples\n⇣ Incorrect code for this rule:\nconst winter = [\"snow\", \"frost\"];\nconst winterCopy = [];\nlet idx;\n\nfor (idx = 0; idx \n⇡ Correct code for this rule:\nconst winter = [\"snow\", \"frost\"];\nconst winterCopy = [...winter];\n\nPrefer spreads over from\nUse spreads ... instead of Array.from to convert an array-like object to an array.\nExamples\n⇜ Avoidable code for this rule:\nconst winter = document.querySelectorAll(\".snow\");\n\nconst nodes = Array.from(winter);\n\n⇢ Recommended code for this rule:\nconst winter = [\"snow\", \"frost\"];\nconst nodes = [...winter];\n\nMapping Over Iterables\nUse Array.from instead of spread ... for mapping over iterables.

It eliminates the need to escape apostrophes e.g the string \"I'm in love with the winter season\" must be changed to 'I\\'m in love with the winter season' when using single quotes.\nSimilarity to other languages. Double quotes are used by many other programming languages like Java, Go and C/C++.\nDouble quotes are used by the JSON notation.\nParallelism to the natural language. Double quotes are used to identify a passage of quoted text. When using single quotes, the reader may misinterpret it as a contraction.

Function declarations are hoisted, which means that it is (too) easy to reference the function before it is defined in the file. This harms readability and maintainability.\nFunctions which definition is too large or complex should be extracted into a own module. Make sure to explicitly name the expression, regardless of whether or not the name is inferred from the containing variable which is often the case in modern browsers or when using compilers such as Babel.

Disallowing unary increment and decrement statements also prevents pre-incrementing/pre-decrementing values unintentionally which can also cause unexpected behavior.\nExceptions are final expression in for loops which can be configured for ESLint by enabling the allowForLoopAfterthoughts option.\n\nESLint: no-plusplus\n\nExamples\n⇣ Incorrect code for this rule:\nconst snowflakes = [1, 2, 3];\nlet flake = 1;\nflake++;\n--flake;\n\nlet total = 0;\nlet allFlakes = 0;\nfor (let i = 0; i \n⇡ Correct code for this rule:\nconst snowflakes = [1, 2, 3];\nlet flake = 1;\nflake += 1;\nflake -= 1;\n\nconst total = snowflakes.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);\nconst allFlakes = snowflakes.filter(Boolean).length;\n\nUnused\nNo variables that are declared and not used anywhere in the code (unused).

Explicitly terminating statements and configuring linters to catch missing semicolons will help to prevent from encountering issues.\nReferences\n\nECMAScript 2018 Specification\nStackOverflow: \"Semicolon before self-invoking function?\"\n\n\nESLint: semi\n\nExamples\n⇣ Incorrect code for this rule:\n\n\nconst snow = {}\nconst frost = {}\n[snow, frost].forEach(element => season.name = \"winter\") // ReferenceError: season is not defined\n\n\nconst winter = \"Sparkling and frozen!\"\n(async function season(){\n  // ...\n}())\n\n\nfunction winter() {\n  return\n    \"The winter season is sparkling and frozen!\"\n}\n// Returns \"undefined\" instead of the value on the next line.\n// Always happens when \"return\" is on a line by itself because of ASI!\nwinter()\n\n⇡ Correct code for this rule:\nconst snow = {};\nconst frost = {};\n[snow, frost].forEach(element => {\n  season.name = \"winter\";\n});\n\n\nconst winter = \"Sparkling and frozen!\";\n(async function season(){\n  // ...\n}());\n\n\nfunction winter() {\n  return \"The winter season is sparkling and frozen!\";\n}\n\n"},"rules/type_casting_and_coercion.html":{"url":"rules/type_casting_and_coercion.html","title":"Type Casting & Coercion","keywords":"","body":"\nExplicitness\nPerform type coercion at the beginning of the statement.\nNo Primitive Wrapper Instances\n\nESlint: no-new-wrappers\n\nStrings\nExamples\n⇣ Incorrect code for this rule:\nthis.snowflakes = 20;\n\n// Type of \"snowflakes\" is \"object\" not \"string\".\nconst snow = new String(this.snowflakes);\n\nthis.snowflakes = 20;\n\n// Invokes \"this.reviewScore.valueOf()\".\nconst snow = this.snowflakes + \"\";\n\nthis.snowflakes = 20;\n\n// Not guaranteed to return a string.\nconst snow = this.snowflakes.toString();\n\n⇡ Correct code for this rule:\nthis.snowflakes = 20;\nconst snow = String(this.snowflakes);\n\nNumbers\nUse Number for type casting and parseInt always with a radix for parsing strings.\n\nESLint: radix and no-new-wrappers\n\nExamples\n⇣ Incorrect code for this rule:\nconst snowflakes = \"4\";\nconst snow = new Number(snowflakes);\n\nconst snowflakes = \"4\";\nconst snow = +snowflakes;\n\nconst snowflakes = \"4\";\nconst snow = snowflakes >> 0;\n\nconst snowflakes = \"4\";\nconst snow = parseInt(snowflakes);\n\n⇡ Correct code for this rule:\nconst snowflakes = \"4\";\nconst snow = Number(snowflakes);\n\nconst snowflakes = \"4\";\nconst snow = parseInt(snowflakes, 10);\n\nBooleans\n\nESLint: no-new-wrappers\n\nExamples\n⇣ Incorrect code for this rule:\nconst snowflakes = 0;\nconst hasFlakes = new Boolean(snowflakes);\n\n⇡ Correct code for this rule:\nconst snowflakes = 0;\nconst hasFlakes = Boolean(snowflakes);\n\n⇢ Recommended code for this rule:\nconst snowflakes = 0;\nconst hasFlakes = !!snowflakes;\n\nBitshift\nBe careful when using bitshift operations!

It may also cause unnecessary re-renders if a brand new function is passed as a prop to a component that uses reference equality check on the prop to determine if it should update.\nNote when used in class fields, it makes them challenging to test and debug, and can negatively impact performance, and because conceptually, class fields are for data, not logic.\nArrow functions are also good to close over local variables. It is handy when used to pass additional data to an event handler.

Varying this API for a subset of the app makes the code less readable and less maintainable, and may cause bugs.\nExamples\n⇣ Incorrect code for this rule:\n\n\n\n\n⇡ Correct code for this rule:\n\n\nCapitalization\nAlways use camelCase for prop names.\nExamples\n⇣ Incorrect code for this rule:\n\n\n⇡ Correct code for this rule:\n\n\nBoolean Attributes Notation\nOmit the value of the prop when it is explicitly true.\n\nESLint: react/jsx-boolean-value\n\nExamples\n⇣ Incorrect code for this rule:\n\n\n⇡ Correct code for this rule:\n\n\n⇢ Recommended code for this rule:\n\n\nNo Index As key\nAvoid using an array index as key prop, always use a unique ID. Not using a stable ID is an anti-pattern because it can negatively impact performance and cause issues with component state. Please see the official React documentation about keys.\n\nESLint: react/no-array-index-key\n\nExamples\n⇣ Incorrect code for this rule:\n{\n  snow.map((snowflake, index) => );\n}\n\n⇡ Correct code for this rule:\n{\n  snow.map(snowflake => );\n}\n\nReferences\n\nIndex as a key is an anti-pattern\n\nExplicit Default Props\nAlways define explicit defaultProps for all non-required props. propTypes are a form of documentation, and providing defaultProps means the reader of the code doesn't have to assume as much. In addition, it can mean that the code can omit certain type checks.\nExamples\n⇣ Incorrect code for this rule:\nfunction Snow({ density, season, snowflakes }) {\n  return (\n    \n      {density}\n      {season}\n      {snowflakes}\n    \n  );\n}\nSnow.propTypes = {\n  density: PropTypes.number.isRequired,\n  season: PropTypes.string,\n  snowflakes: PropTypes.node\n};\n\n⇡ Correct code for this rule:\nfunction Snow({ density, season, snowflakes }) {\n  return (\n    \n      {density}\n      {season}\n      {snowflakes}\n    \n  );\n}\nSnow.propTypes = {\n  density: PropTypes.number.isRequired,\n  season: PropTypes.string,\n  snowflakes: PropTypes.node\n};\nSnow.defaultProps = {\n  season: \"winter\",\n  snowflakes: null\n};\n\nSpread Props\nUse spread props sparingly. Otherwise unnecessary props can be passed down to components. For React v15.6.1 and older, this can result in passing down invalid HTML attributes to the DOM.\nExceptions\nHigher-Order Components\nHOCs that proxy down props and hoist propTypes.\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\";\n\nexport const withSnow = ComposedComponent =>\n  class WithSnow extends Component {\n    static propTypes = {\n      season: PropTypes.string,\n      isFalling: PropTypes.bool\n    };\n\n    render() {\n      return ;\n    }\n  };\n\nfunction withSnow(ComposedComponent) {\n  return class WithSnow extends React.Component {\n    WithSnow.propTypes = {\n      season: PropTypes.string,\n      isFalling: PropTypes.bool\n    };\n\n    render() {\n      return \n    }\n  }\n}\n\nSpreading Explicitly Known Props\nSpreading objects with known, explicit props.
