Every major open source project has its own style guide, a set of standards and conventions for the writing and design of code, documentations and assets. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style.

A style guide establishes and enforces style to improve the intelligibility and communication within the project community. It ensures consistency and enforces best practice in usage and language composition.

### Getting Started

The [project documentation][docs] contains chapters to learn about
the [comprehensive base rule set][docs-rules] including [ECMAScript +6 (ES 2015+)][docs-rules-ecmascript_6+_styles] and [React][docs-rules-react] specific styles like e.g. [Higher-Order Components][docs-rules-react-hoc], the [component methods & properties ordering][docs-rules-react-ordering-methods_and_properties] and [props][docs-rules-react-props].

The development chapters contain information about the [requirements][docs-dev-requirements] and [how to build][docs-dev-building] the style guide documentation.

### Contributing

Read the [contributing guide][docs-dev-contributing] to learn about the development process and how to propose [enhancement suggestions][docs-dev-contributing-enhancements] and [report bugs][docs-dev-contributing-bug-reports], how to [submit pull requests][docs-dev-contributing-pr] and the project's [styleguides][docs-dev-contributing-styleguides], [branch organization][docs-dev-contributing-branch-org] and [versioning][docs-dev-contributing-versioning] model.

The guide also includes information about [minimal, complete, and verifiable examples][docs-dev-contributing-mcve] and other ways to contribute to the project like [improving existing issues][docs-dev-contributing-other-improve-issues] and [giving feedback on issues and pull requests][docs-dev-contributing-other-feedback].
