Every major open source project has its own style guide, a set of standards and conventions for the writing and design of code, documentations and assets. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style.

A style guide establishes and enforces style to improve the intelligibility and communication within the project community. It ensures consistency and enforces best practice in usage and language composition.

### Getting Started

This style guide provides the [comprehensive base rule set][rules] including [ECMAScript +6 (ES 2015+) styles][rules-ecmascript_6+_styles].

The development chapters contain information about the [requirements][dev-requirements] and [how to build][dev-building] this style guide documentation.

### Contributing

Read the [contributing guide][dev-contributing] to learn about the development process and how to propose [enhancement suggestions][dev-contributing-enhancements] and [report bugs][dev-contributing-bug-reports], how to [submit pull requests][dev-contributing-pr] and the project's [styleguides][dev-contributing-styleguides], [branch organization][dev-contributing-branch-org] and [versioning][dev-contributing-versioning] model.

The guide also includes information about [minimal, complete, and verifiable examples][dev-contributing-mcve] and other ways to contribute to the project like [improving existing issues][dev-contributing-other-improve-issues] and [giving feedback on issues and pull requests][dev-contributing-other-feedback].
